🚀 **UI Automation Challenge**

This repository contains automated test scenarios for the UI of The Movie Database (TMDb). The tests are implemented using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG.

🎯 **Test Scenarios**

1. ✅ **Successful Login**: Verify successful user login.

2. ❌ **Failed Login**: Verify handling of invalid login credentials with error message validation.

3. 🔍 **Successful Search**: Ensure successful search functionality with the input 'Fight Club'.

4. 🎥 **Verify Movie Genre Filter**: Validate the application of the movie genre filter.

5. 🎭 **Validate Acting Timeline**: Confirm the accuracy of the acting timeline for selected actors.

6. 📆 **Sort by Dates on Ascending Order**: Test sorting movies by ascending dates.

Each scenario is based on a main page class and extends to a specific test case, enabling code reuse and maintaining an organized structure for test automation.

2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, etc.).

3. Update the WebDriver path in the configuration files.
