🚀 UI Automation Challenge

This repository contains automated test scenarios for the UI of The Movie Database (TMDb). The tests are implemented using Selenium WebDriver and TestNG.

🎯 Test Scenarios

The test scenarios cover a range of key interactions within The Movie Database (TMDb) application:

✅ Successful Login: Verify successful user login.
❌ Failed Login: Verify handling of invalid login credentials with error message validation.
🔍 Successful Search: Ensure successful search functionality with the input 'Fight Club'.
🎥 Verify Movie Genre Filter: Validate the application of the movie genre filter.
🎭 Validate Acting Timeline: Confirm the accuracy of the acting timeline for selected actors.
📆 Sort by Dates on Ascending Order: Test sorting movies by ascending dates.
Each scenario is based on a main page class and extends to a specific test case, enabling code reuse and maintaining an organized structure for test automation.
